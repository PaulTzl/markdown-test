Markdown test

Uploaded by dragging into GitHub web editor (so the image is automatically uploaded and the following markdown is created):

```
![Dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4710174/155334519-87dabc32-b887-4eb9-8d75-1c732f167112.svg)
```

In this example, I have uploaded the same image into this repo and referenced it in this markdown (the ability to do this isn't new):

```
